NAME
       gopass - Create and manage passwords

SYNOPSIS
       gopass [--cipher blowfish|md5] [--file filename] [--password password]
       realm username roles...


DESCRIPTION
       The gopass program creates authentication passwords for GoAhead in the
       nominated authentication configuration file.  GoAhead uses the same
       authorization file and format for Basic, Digest and web-form
       authentication. This simplifies           administration.

       password will be displayed to the standard output.

OPTIONS
       --cipher blowfish|md5
              Specifies the cipher to use to hash the password. Default is
              blowfish. Blowfish is substantially more secure.  MD5 must be used
              for digest authentication.

       --password password
              Specifies a password to use to for the user.

       --file filename
              Update the specified password configuration file.

DESCRIPTION
       The gopass program is used to create and manage user passwords.  GoAhead
       uses the same authorization file and format for Basic, Digest and Post
       authentication stores. This simplifies administration.
